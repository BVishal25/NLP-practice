# NLP-practice
I am practicing my NLP skills by learning NLP and techniques. I am writing my understanding through this.

## What is NLP?
NLP is a sub-field of AI where making the machines to understand human speech and the emotions within it and have an amazing interaction with humans.

## Why need NLP for Tamil language?
As Tamil language has a 5000 years of history and my mother tongue too. It is already a challenge to train a NLP for english language which only has 26 letters, but in Tamil there are whooping 247 letters present. It is a biggest challenge to train Tamil with NLP and work it finely. But it needs to be done.

## Process
(cooking anology)
1. Select a dish [select a problem]
2. prepare the ingredients [Text Preprocessing]
3. Cook with certain technique [NLP techniques]
4. Taste and adjust [train and test]
5. serve it hot/cold [finished product]

## Text Preprocessing
(cooking anology)
This is a fantastic step. It is not only important to select the ingredient (raw text), it is also important to cut it into bitable size (tokenization) according to the dish (problem), peel the skins (punctuation and stop words removal), remove unnecessary parts (stemming), make the ingredient into simple from its complex form ie. Banana flower (lemmatization)

1. raw text
2. tokenization
3. punctuation and stop words removal
4. stemming
5. lemmatization

### Raw Text
Each ingredient give the different taste, like that each text (file) has different content which is used to cook variety of models. So choosing a data set is verty important for making a NLP model.

### Tokenization // Punctuation and stop words removal
We all have small mouth. We can only chew the ingredient if it fits the mouth and it is easy to digest. like that tokening (small part) the text is necessary to train a NLP model. There are types of tokenization

1. Word tokenization (word by word cutting)
2. sentence tokenization (sentence by sentence cutting)

punctuation and stop words removal also comes under tokenization but it is a some specific process. You see, a peeled ingredients is good. Because the skin doesn't have the taste, all tastes are inside. So you know what to do.
